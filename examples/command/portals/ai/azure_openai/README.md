# Azure OpenAI

This hands-on example uses Ockam to create an end-to-end encrypted portal to a private Azure OpenAI API.

We connect a python app in one virtual private network with an Azure OpenAI API configured via private endpoint in another virtual private network.
The example uses the Azure CLI to create these virtual networks.
